The Online Notes Manager is a web-based application designed to help users create, organize, and manage their notes efficiently from any device with internet access. The application provides a simple and user-friendly interface that allows users to add, edit, delete, and categorize notes with ease.

Users can write detailed notes, assign categories, set reminder dates, and pin important notes for quick access. The pinning feature ensures that important notes always appear at the top, improving productivity and organization. The reminder functionality helps users stay on track by notifying them about important tasks or deadlines.

The application supports both guest mode and authenticated user mode. In guest mode, users can create notes that are temporarily stored in the browser’s local storage. Once the user logs in, all locally saved notes are automatically synchronized with the server, ensuring data persistence and security.

The Online Notes Manager is built using modern web technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the front-end, and Flask with a database on the back-end. This architecture ensures a responsive user experience, secure data handling, and scalability.
